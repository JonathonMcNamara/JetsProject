# JetsProject

## How To Run
  The program is run by starting the console and from there the user will be prompted with a menu
  The user will then interact with the console and choose one of the selections listed on the menu 
  The program will not stop running until the user has chosen the Quit function on the options

## Project Description
  This program stores an ArrayList of 5 jets that the user can manipulate based on the menu selections
  They can also add their own Jet (which will be a PassengerJet) to the list of jets as well as removing jets themselves
  There are a few functions that they user can select that will load the cargo jets as well as load the fighter jets with ammunition
  They can see all jets, see the fastest, and see the one with the longest range as well 

## Technologies Used
  This program uses abstract classes as well as implementing Interfaces to call certain methods
  Implementing interfaces is directly correlated with the dogfight and the loadcargo functions
  There are also a few loops, a switch, if statements, methods, setters, getters and public/private functions

## Lessons Learned
  I felt a lot better with where the start with this program. I should have spent more time doing some of the stretch goals
  It is nice once you understand the layout of where everything needs to go so that the files are easier to navigate and have a cleanness to them
